# MongoDB Overview: 

MongoDB is a cross-platform, document oriented NoSQL database that provides, high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. MongoDB uniquely allows users to mix and match multiple storage engines within a single deployment. This flexibility provides a more simple and reliable approach to meeting diverse application needs for data. Traditionally, multiple database technologies would need to be managed to meet these needs, with complex, custom integration code to move data between the technologies, and to ensure consistent, secure access.

MongoDB stores data as documents in a binary representation called BSON (Binary JSON). Documents that share a similar structure are typically organized as collections. You can think of collections as being analogous to a table in a relational database: documents are similar to rows, and fields are similar to columns.

## Advantages

* MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.

* The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with

* Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data

* MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use

* Schema less âˆ’ MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.


# MongoDB on the AWS Cloud: 

The MongoDB cluster (version 2.6 or 3.0) makes use of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, and is launched via a AWS CloudFormation template. You can use the template directly or you can copy and then customize it as needed.  The template creates the following resources:

* VPC with private and public subnets (you can also launch the cluster into an existing VPC).

* A NAT instance in the public subnet to support SSH access to the cluster and outbound Internet connectivity.

* An IAM instance role with fine-grained permissions.

* Security groups

* A fully customized MongoDB cluster with replica sets, shards, and config servers, along with customized EBS storage, all running in the private subnet.

* The document examines scaling, replication, and performance tradeoffs in depth, and provides guidance to help you to choose appropriate types of EC2 instances and EBS volumes.
