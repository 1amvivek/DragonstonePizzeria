## What is Golang? How is it evolved?

Go is a programming language that didn’t evolve from the existing programming languages, such as Java and C#. This programming language focuses on real-world practices for building the next-generation applications on the cloud, computing environments, and system programming.  
Go is a statically typed, garbage-collected, natively compiled programming language that mostly belongs to the C family of languages in terms of basic syntax. Go provides an expressive syntax with it’s lightweight type system and comes with concurrency as a built-in feature at the language level. Go provides performance comparable to C and C++ while offering rapid development.

# Benefits of Programming with Golang

Some of the important benefits/advantages of Golang are as follows:

#1 - Highly Concurrent  
#2 - Approachable for the Whole Team  
#3 - Excellent Performance

There are other advantages such as: 
* Go compiles very quickly.
* Go supports concurrency at the language level.
* Functions are first class objects in Go.
* Go has garbage collection.
* Strings and maps are built into the language. 

# Implementing Go Framework for AWS Lambda

Go offers a solid toolchain and set of primitives to write AWS Lambda services. The following are the features that Go offers:

- Single binary deployment
- Excellent concurrency primitives
- An official AWS Go SDK
- Extremely fast compilation
- Well-defined error handling patterns
- Static types
- Minimal startup overhead
- Cross-platform compilation
- Rich standard library
