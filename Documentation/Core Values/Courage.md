## Courage in Agile
From the principles in the Agile Manifesto, it is clear that Agile practices foster if not mandate an environment that empowers developers to always strive to achieve a higher quality product in a highly efficient fashion. In order to achieve this, however, it is imperative that the members of an Agile team demonstrate a great deal of courage.

To analyze the aforementioned statement, we refer to the following principles in the Agile Manifesto:
1. **Welcoming changes at late stages of development requires courage.** A developer must put aside any fears of additional effort or closing deadlines in order to adapt quickly to any changes in the requirements for customer's market advantage.
2. Working very closely with the business requires **courage to speak up and convey details** - good or bad - in a timely manner. This, additionally, involves, owning up to any mistakes and setting aside all apprehension while asking the right questions needed in order to alleviate misunderstandings and deliver the best product.
3. **By providing an environment of motivated, trusting, skilled and supportive individuals in a group, developers are enabled to be more courageous in endeavors** (like learning new technologies) that they would otherwise be apprehensive about undertaking.
4. **It takes courage to request for and speak up in a face-to-face conversation** which, in agile terms, is the most efficient and effective means of communication.
5. Being Agile involves continuous attention to excellence and reflection on the progress of a team to ensure a high-quality product. This is only made possible if team members **show courage in speaking out to take ownership for or call out potential errors** that could be detrimental to the product being developed as well as to **seek the help needed** in order to achieve the lofty standards of excellence that are required.
  
From the above, it is clear why Courage is a Core Value in an Agile Environment
  
  
  
## Courage shown in Week 1
In week 1 of development, the core agile value of Courage was championed in the following instances:
* On 18 September (Mon), after no updates on GitHub or email, I decided to inquire with Judy and Chaya (TAs for CMPE 281 and repository owners with respect to this project) about how we are to proceed with the project. A short discussion later, it was clear that in spite of having sent the GitHub invitation to collaborate on the private repository, I had not received a notification on email or GitHub. At this point, in line with Agile principles, I requested to speak face to face with either TA in order to quickly sort out the issue and on 19 September, a quick discussion requesting a few more invites after changes to notification and email settings in GitHub, I received the invitation and was successfully added to the repository.
Here, courage was demonstrated in the following instances:
    1. **Speaking up when there was no invitation** instead of waiting for one until it was too late.
    2. **Requesting a quick face-to-face discussion** with the TAs in order to fix the impediment to continue the project.

* Further, on hearing about the project, I was inclined toward using AWS Lambda in order to devise a solution given its highly scalable nature but I was also unsure if this complied with the requirements put forward by Professor Paul for the Term Project. In a demonstration of courage within an Agile context, **I requested clarification from the professor in a quick chat post class** and was made aware that the expectations were different for the project. **Subsequently, I courageously admitted to the team that I was wrong** on the idea of building a project architecture that revolved around lambda and requested that we look for other means of devising a solution.

* Lastly, on 22 September (Fri) it was apparent that all the developers in the team have had highly limited exposure to the markdown format used for Readmes and wiki pages. However, in a **demonstration of courage enabled by a project group of motivated individuals, I was able to dive head-first into tutorials, use the format and encourage the rest of the team to do the same devoid of any hesitation.**
  
  
  
## Courage shown in Week 2
* As per discussions following week 1, it was decided that AWS Lambda will not be used. However, on doing further research on the topic, it seemed like a perfect solution to a vast majority of the problems associated with scaling and **in keeping with values of courage, a second discussion with Professor Paul ensued which resulted in AWS Lambda being back in consideration.**
* Team brogrammers as a unit **displayed courage in the team meeting while proposing various architectural decisions** like using Angular and Node for the front end in order to maintain consistency at the user's end and attempting to make AWS Lambdas with Go in spite of having no experience with the language apart from CMPE 281 class.  
  
  
  
## Courage shown in Week 3
* At the Silicon Valley Code Camp session on "AWS Lambda" and "Good-bye VM, Hello Docker", keeping with the Agile value of Courage, we asked the instructor on various means of deploying Go code to AWS Lambda and discussed the Pros and Cons of the approach.
* In a display of Courage, I asked the TA's for CMPE 281 class for help configuring the required settings in order to set up a CICD pipeline to Heroku as this requires Admin privileges to the Repository.
