# Agile Core Value Feedback

Feedback loops serve as opportunities to increase productivity, either in an individual’s performance or in project teamwork or process. Identifying areas for improvement throughout each sprint and turning them into action items can help you track and address the key challenges related to technology or product improvement.

Frequent feedback is vital for Agile development teams to understand whether the team is going in the direction as expected. 
if the feedback is obtained at the end of every iteration, it may be very easy for the team to make up the feedback and go along.It also serves as an important tool to adopt modifications in the application.
Highest business value features are delivered first to the customer by development teams through the use of early and frequent feedback.

**Updates from week 1**

* Based on feedback, the development team decided to have the weekly Stand-up meeting to discuss about the updates and issues of the project.

* Constant feedbacks were given by every team member to finalise a better team name.

* One of the team members suggested to use Jira or waffle. The team agreed to the suggestion and decided to try waffle or Jira for the upcoming week.

**Updates from week 2**  

* feedbacks to prepare a documentation folder to thoroughly document every week’s core values updates and project research topics done by each member.
* Following the discussions from week 1 about implementing AWS Lambda in our project, positive feedbacks were given by the team members about implementation part and the advantages of having a serverless architecture finally resulted in incorporating Lambda into our system architecture.
* feedbacks to implement MongoDB database helped us to take a very quick decision on the technology stack for our application when we were very confused.
* One more example where feedback system continues to successfully help us reach project goals is when we were not sure, whether we can or should achieve front end consistency in our application. One of our team members dropped in a idea based on his own experience for implementing web sockets using Node.js to achieve front-end consistency. This further helped in improving our system architecture.

**Updates from week 3**  

* feedbacks were given to form groups in communication platforms to discuss efficiently about the achievements and problems faced by the team members.
* feedbacks about the time constraints that each member has was taken into account and the team was ready to help each other with the tasks.  
* Team members gave their opinions about the new technologies that they learnt in the silicon valley code camp and gave feedbacks about the technologies that can be used for the betterment of the project.

**Updates from week 4**  

* feedback about the project architechture design was given constantly by each team member to come up with the best design.
* Each team member shared their research updates for the week and the links to get feedback.  
* All the team members reviewed the other members' work and the sample code shared.
