# Commitment  
## Commitment in Agile  
A simple definition of Commitment is about dedication that applies to the actions, the effort and not the final result. Commitment is and remains a core value of Agile methodology. The team members must be committed to success and be willing to create realistic goals and stick to them. Everyone should participate in the team to achieve an "all in situation" where everyone work together to meet their commitments and achieve team goals.

The Team commits to:
- Holding each other accountable to do whatever it takes to meet their commitments
- Creating and holding each other accountable to any team agreements they have made
- Believing that a whole team commitment means that the team succeeds or fails together

## Commitment shown in Week 1

The following are the core agile value of Commitment noticed in Week 1 of development:

* In the week 1 of development and project team discussions, everyone was able to participate and articulate their ideas to achieve team goals. For instance, as majority of the team members were familiar with AWS Lambda and insisted on using AWS Lambda for the project, the other team members were ready to put efforts in learning and working together to achieve the team goals, which clearly demonstrates the core idea behind commitment.

* During the hours of creating  wiki pages and updating Readme pages, the teammates were ready to help others who weren't exposed to Markdown format for updating wiki pages, which again clearly indicates the team members working and learning together as a team to achieve team goals and attain success.

## Commitment shown in Week 2

The following are the core agile value of Commitment noticed in Week 2 of development:

* In the week 2 of development and project team discussions,it was noticed that every member in the project has put lot of efforts in researching for ideas about the design and architecture of SaaS projects. In this way, some good time was spent in pooling various ideas and important things taken care during development from all the team members. Thus, it clearly shows the pure commitment and efforts put by every team member to reach the project goals.

* In this past week, there came a situation when one of our team members was little sick and down due to the climate change, but he successfully participated in one of our team discussions through google hangouts and that again immensely shows a positive attitude towards 'working together as a team'.

* In the week 2 team meeting on 29/09/2017, everyone was able to participate in-person and bring out ideas to further the design and development of our application. This assures that there has been a lot of efforts put by every team member to reach towards the agile core value of commitment successfully.

## Commitment shown in Week 3

The following are the core agile value of Commitment noticed in Week 3 of development:

* In the week 3 of development and project discussions, every team member like they promised in the previous week 2 meeting have completed a small demo implementation in their particular domain, which further proves how commitment plays a major role in team sucess.

* Further, every team member attended some major sessions in Silicon Valley Code Camp, like how to use AWs with Serverless Lambda and Java, etc. All five memebers in our team attended multiple sessions , so that each team member can incorporate the knowledge absorbed from these sessions into the project. This again shows the commitment and efforts taken by each member to work towards the team goals.
