# Communication

## Communication in Agile
Agile principles help the team members of a software project manage the development process in an efficient manner.
Agile teams are known to be highly efficient at getting work done. <br></br>Because **Agile teams share a collaborative culture**, efficiency tends to have a ripple effect. One of the core principles behind the infamous Agile Manifesto is **Communication**.


Innovation occurs only with the free interchange of conflicting ideas, which makes communication one of the very important Agile principles. Communication is all about shared understanding among the members of the Project team, when followed efficiently results in a high quality product.
<br></br>
The Agile Manifesto reads: 
<br/>_"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools."_<br/>
which effectively means that the Agile principles, as described in Agile Manifesto, place people before processes and tools, working software over documentation, **collaboration over negotiation** and change management over project planning.


Communication methodologies can range from every few minutes with pair programming, to every few hours with continuous integration, to every day with a daily stand-up meeting, to every iteration with a review and retrospective. The mode of communication has to be chosen in the best interest of the team.
<br>There are several forms of communication that can be adopted by the Agile teams based on the team's convenience. Some of them can be:
* The traditional **face-to-face meetings** conducted in each team. This method is described as the most efficient since the team members can openly communicate about the project status to all the team members, discuss impediments and solutions for the issues. 
* A **Task Board** with sticky notes in every step of the Project Life-cycle describing the backlogs and issues being faced. The task board is a great way to quickly show your project team the status of a project. 
* **Electronic communication** methods such as E-mails or using any other Internet messengers can be useful to teams having members in different locations and also help diffuse non-urgent information.


## Updates from Week 1
In Week 1 of the Project development, the Agile core value of Communication was enforced by the following:
* A **weekly face-to-face meeting** was held in which the team discussed: 
    <ol>
       <li>the Agile core values to be followed during the course of the development.</li>
       <li>the name of our Product was discussed and finalized.</li>
       <li>the research tasks to be done by each team member on their respective Agile core value and update in the Wiki.</li> 
       </ol>

* One of the team members **helped the entire team understand** the usage of Markdown format for updating the GitHub Wiki and Readme pages since not all the members have had experience with Markdown format.

* The team also communicated about their assigned tasks using an **electronic mode of communication**(an internet messenger).

* Finally, the development team decided to have a weekly Stand-up meeting to discuss about the updates and issues of the project.

## Updates from Week 2
In Week 2 of the development process:
* The team had a weekly scrum meeting to discuss about the progress of the project.

* All the team members are putting in their best efforts to communicate with each other regarding the project development.

* The team discussed about the system architecture of the project and decided on the components that each team member will be responsible for, making sure each member was fine with their assigned work.

* The team also discussed the tasks to be done for the upcoming week making sure nobody has a problem with their schedules.

## Updates from Week 3
In Week 3 of the development process:
* The team had a weekly scrum meeting to discuss about the progress made by each team member.

* The team also discussed the difficulties that each member is facing regarding time constraints due to other courses' work load.

* The team also discussed the tasks to be done for the upcoming week making sure the tasks fit in with everyone's schedule. 

* We have formed groups in multiple Internet based communication services for ease of discussions, to constantly understand the problems being faced by all the members and trying to resolve the issues together, as a team.

## Updates from Week 4
In Week 3 of the development process:
* The team had a weekly scrum meeting to discuss about the progress made by each team member.

* The major means of communication, during this week, has been through Internet medium. We have not faced any problems or miscommunication using Internt based services up until now.
